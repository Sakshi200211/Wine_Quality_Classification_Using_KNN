Wine Quality Classification using KNN involves predicting wine quality based on its features (like alcohol content and acidity). The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm classifies the wine by comparing it to the closest labeled samples in the data, assigning it the most common quality label among its nearest neighbors.
